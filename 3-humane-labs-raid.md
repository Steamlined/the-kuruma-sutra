*Cars* - As fast as possible!
Before the mission, both buyer and bodyguard pair and the Lookout pair should agree who drives. (One driver per pair)

### The Mission
1. Take the cars to the way point. Get in position, and wait for the best cut scen ever. ("Oh no the FIB what are these clowns doing here!")
2. As soon as the cutscene ends, south lookout should explode the cars at the front of the parking lot. 
3. At the same time, buyer and bodyguard should run for the [garage](##ss##). They should focus on shooting any FIB agents they see.
4. The South Lookout should focus on the front and side alleys, and the north lookout should focus on the back and side alleys.
5. When all bar one or two of the agents are dead, the lookouts should climb down the ladder. Buyer and bodyguard grab the case, and get in the car the seller arrived in. Lookouts should get in the green car [here](##ss##)
6. Kill the last few FIB agents, and then follow the waypoint back to the heist appartment. Watch out for any FIB cars, you will probably get your wheels shot out!
