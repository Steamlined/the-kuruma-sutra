# Heist 2: The Prison Break
This heist can be a pain in the ass, if done the intended route. However the setups for it are reasonably easy and with a bit of practice this heist will become one of the easiest.

## Setup 1: Plane
### Setup
**Pilot** - Needs to be good at flying, have reasonable armor and health - likely to take a few hits.  
**Ground Team** - Should be semi-decent at combat, AP Pistol or Micro SMG suggested.  
*Cars* - Minimum of 1 Karuma, 3 to 4 Karumas preferred.  


###The Mission
1. Take up to 4 Karumas up the eastern highway to McKensie airfield - see fastest route [here](##ss##)
2. Put on your mask, and start shooting Vagos.
3. Prioritize people around hangar to clear path for pilot - by the sides of hangar and containers opposite the hangar are good areas
4. Pilot gets to the Velum when clear as possible - this should be before second wave of cars
5. While Pilot gets in to Velum and starts taxiing, ground team clear the runway of cars - ram them with Karumas to clear the runway
6. As soon as the runway is clear, pilot should take off. Take the plane to LSI as instructed, you will not encounter any more resistance.
7. Ground Team should now simply kill the rest of the Vagos. To speed this up, try and intercept them as they drive down the roads towards the runway.
8. The last Vago car will spawn on the bridge near the hangar, try to have someone nearby to speed things up
9. When all Vagos have gone leave area. Head towards Sandy Shores to pick up more armor if it is required.



## Setup 2: Bus
### Setup
**Bus Driver** - One player needs to actually drive the bus. They should have good armor, they WILL be shot! :)  
**Rocket Man** - One player needs to have a rocket launcher or sniper rifle to take down a helicopter  
*Cars:* As many Karumas as possible! Those without should ride along in other Karumas  


###The Mission
1. Take the Karumas up the eastern highway to the bridge near Sandy Shores
2. Set up at least one Karuma at the end of the bridge closest to the windfarm
3. While waiting for the bus to arrive, the Rocket Man should shoot down the helicopter. Get back in your Karuma ASAP - you will start being shot!
4. When the bus arrives, take out the driver. The Bus Driver should get into the bus.
5. Drive up towards the wind farm. [Screenshot](##ss##)
6. Drive up the slope and move around the hill if needed. It should be easy enough to hide without moving though. [Screenshot](##ss##)
7. When everyone has lost the cops drive to the indicated marker. Watch out for any cop cars around, crashing into them will cause issues!


## Setup 3: Station
### Team 1: Police Station
* Hide somewhere undercover and out of the way, call 911
* Kill police when they arrive
* Steal cop car, hide in the sewers until they lose you
* Finish setup as normal

### Team 2: Steal Car

* One player climb to top of second crane ##SS##
* Pick up parachute, equip it in interaction menu (Interaction > Inventory > Parachute > on)
* Parachute off to top off boat then to ship
* Trigger cutscene (other player is teleported over automatically)
* Steal car and drive to Sandy Shores - follow yellow line
* Note: Although the voiceover says damage matters, it does not not. Justy don't get a wanted level!

## Setup 4: Wet work
### Team 1: Assasinate Popov
* Take a fast car to the waypoint.
* Go slightly down the road, and climb over the wall [here](##ss##)
* Follow the path until you reach the steps [screenshots](##ss##)
* Throw a sticky bomb onto the van
* This will alert the guards, making Popov run. Retracer your steps and climb over the wall
* Wait for Popov to get into the van - his red icon will stop moving on the map as he gets in
* When he is in the van detonate the sticky bomb
* Kaboom! Leave the area

### Team 2: Steal briefcase

* Climb ladder, both take sniper aim on rooftop, kill both in sync.
* Climb down ladder, get into Karuma
* Driver take Karuma round to briefcase - shield passenger from cops
* Passenger gets out, collect case and gest back in
* Drive to shopping centre underground carpark and hide from police [Map](##ss##)
* Return briefcase to planning room when police are gone.

## Finale:
* Roles: Prison Officer should have good guns and armour. Prisoner needs some armour
Pilot needs to be familar with basic flying, and Demolitionist should be good with combat helicopters.
