###The Mission
* Take up to 4 Karumas up the eastern highway to McKensie airfield - see fastest route [here](##ss##)
* Put on your mask, and start shooting Vagos.
* Prioritize people around hangar to clear path for pilot - by the sides of hangar and containers opposite the hangar are good areas
* Pilot gets to the Velum when clear as possible - this should be before second wave of cars
* While Pilot gets in to Velum and starts taxiing, ground team clear the runway of cars - ram them with Karumas to clear the runway
* As soon as the runway is clear, pilot should take off. Take the plane to LSI as instructed, you will not encounter any more resistance.
* Ground Team should now simply kill the rest of the Vagos. To speed this up, try and intercept them as they drive down the roads towards the runway.
* The last Vago car will spawn on the bridge near the hangar, try to have someone nearby to speed things up
* When all Vagos have gone leave area. Head towards Sandy Shores to pick up more armor if it is required.
